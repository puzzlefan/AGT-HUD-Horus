Here the commands are defined for the communication
Each command is one byte long and because we can represented by the decimal number

when no command preceded the recived bytes the byte count = 0

000 = Client initial case
001 = Client is going to send his data
002 = Client wants the Data from Server
003 = Client knows that all data has been transfered

100 = Client send in next 4 bytes the id
101 = Client sends integers array, byte count can be calculated with 4 * integerCount
102 = Client sends bools array , byte count can be calculated with 4 * boolCount
103 = Client send message next byte count equals messageLength
104 = Client sends BITBild next, byte count equals BITBildSize;

200 = Server sends integers array, byte count can be calculated with 4 * integerCount
201 = Server sends bools array , byte count can be calculated with 4 * boolCount
202 = Server send message next byte count equals messageLength

253 = end of actual transmission
254 = error
255 = response to error to reestablish link
